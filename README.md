# 🚀 Jenkins Crash Course: CI/CD with Jenkins

## 📖 Course Overview
This crash course is designed to provide you with a hands-on understanding of **Jenkins**, **Continuous Integration (CI)**, and **Continuous Delivery (CD)** pipelines. By the end of this course, you will understand the fundamental concepts behind Jenkins, the benefits of CI/CD, how to configure Jenkins jobs, and how to trigger Jenkins pipelines from external systems.

## 📚 Course Contents

### 🧱 **Module 1: What is Jenkins?**
#### ➤ **Definition:**
Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate parts of the software development lifecycle, particularly building, testing, and deploying code.

#### ➤ **Analogy:**
Think of Jenkins as a robotic butler that watches your code and performs tasks every time you update it. For example, it might run tests, build Docker images, or deploy to staging.

---

### 🧩 **Module 2: Why Jenkins? Why CI/CD?**
#### ➤ **Problem Before Jenkins:**
- Manual deployments
- Forgetting steps in the deployment process
- "It works on my machine" bugs
- Time-consuming and inconsistent tests

#### ➤ **CI/CD Overview:**
- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Automatically tests and builds your application when someone pushes code to your repository.
- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):** Automatically deploys the tested code to staging or production environments.

CI/CD automates the **Build-Test-Deploy lifecycle**, improving the speed and reliability of software delivery.

---

### ⚙️ **Module 3: Jenkins Architecture**
#### ➤ **Key Components:**
- **Master (Controller):** Orchestrates jobs, runs the user interface (UI), and manages the job queue.
- **Agent (Worker):** Executes the actual build steps. Agents can be Docker containers, remote servers, EC2 instances, Kubernetes pods, etc.
- **Plugins:** Jenkins is extremely extensible through plugins. Plugins enable Jenkins to work with tools such as Git, Docker, Slack, AWS, and Kubernetes.

---

### 🔁 **Module 4: Jenkins Job Types**
#### ➤ **Freestyle Jobs:**
- These are GUI-based jobs that are simple to configure.
- They are good for one-off jobs or legacy jobs.
  
#### ➤ **Pipeline Jobs (💡 Prefer this):**
- Written in **Groovy** and defined within a `Jenkinsfile`.
- **Code as configuration**: The Jenkins pipeline definition is version-controlled, allowing better collaboration and automation.

Example Jenkins pipeline written in Groovy:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make build'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'pytest tests/'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 🚀 **Module 5: Basic Workflow**
#### **Example Pipeline (CI):**
1. **Developer pushes code to GitHub.**
2. **Jenkins watches the repository** for changes.
3. **Trigger a pipeline** that:
   - Clones the code from GitHub.
   - Builds the application.
   - Runs unit tests.
   - Sends the result to Slack.
   - Deploys the application to the staging environment (CD).

---

### 🧠 **Module 6: Hands-On Practice**
#### **🔨 Tools to Use:**
- **GitHub repo** with a simple Python/Flask or Node.js application.
- **Jenkins running locally** (Docker recommended).
- **GitHub webhook** to trigger Jenkins jobs on every push.

#### **How to Trigger Jenkins Externally:**
You will learn how to trigger Jenkins jobs externally by using APIs or custom scripts (e.g., Python scripts).

---

## 🔑 Key Learnings:
- Understanding **Jenkins** and its components (Master, Agent, Plugins).
- The importance of **CI/CD** in modern software development.
- How to write and configure Jenkins **Pipeline Jobs** using **Groovy**.
- Automating build, test, and deployment workflows with Jenkins.
- Hands-on practice with real-world tools like **GitHub**, **Docker**, and **Slack**.
- Triggering Jenkins jobs externally using **webhooks** and custom scripts.

---

## 🏆 Test & Certification
At the end of the course, you will be given a test to evaluate your understanding of Jenkins, Groovy, Docker, and CI/CD concepts. This test includes both theoretical and practical questions.
