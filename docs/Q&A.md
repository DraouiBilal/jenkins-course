# 📝 Jenkins Understanding Test

## 🎯 Objective:
This test is designed to assess your understanding of Jenkins, CI/CD concepts, Groovy scripting, and how Jenkins can be automated and triggered externally. Answer the following questions to demonstrate your knowledge.

---

## 🚀 Part 1: Basic Jenkins Concepts

1. **What is Jenkins and why is it important in modern software development?**
   
2. **Explain the difference between Jenkins pipelines and freestyle jobs.**

3. **What are the key components of Jenkins architecture?**

4. **How does Jenkins integrate with version control systems like Git?**

---

## 🔧 Part 2: Jenkins Configuration & Usage

5. **Describe the process of setting up a Jenkins job to build a Python application. Include steps like configuring source control, setting build triggers, and setting up post-build actions.**

6. **What is a Jenkins Slave and how does it relate to Jenkins Master?**

7. **Explain how you would use Docker within Jenkins to build and deploy an application. What are the benefits of using Docker in Jenkins pipelines?**

8. **In Jenkins, what is the purpose of the `buildWithParameters` API endpoint and how would you trigger a Jenkins job with parameters using a Python script?**

---

## 💻 Part 3: Groovy Scripting in Jenkins

9. **Write a simple Groovy script to perform the following actions in a Jenkins pipeline:**
   - Print the Jenkins environment variables.
   - Clone a Git repository.
   - Build the project using `mvn` (for a Java project).
   
10. **What is the difference between declarative and scripted pipelines in Jenkins? Which one would you recommend for most use cases, and why?**

---

## 🧑‍💻 Part 4: Advanced Jenkins Usage

11. **How would you use Jenkins to trigger builds automatically when changes are pushed to a GitHub repository? Provide details about the GitHub webhook and any Jenkins plugins that are required.**

12. **Explain the concept of "Pipeline as Code". What are its advantages over manually configured Jenkins jobs?**

13. **How can you handle secrets (like API keys or passwords) securely in Jenkins?**

---

## 🐍 Part 5: External Jenkins Job Triggering

14. **What is the purpose of the Jenkins REST API, and how would you use it to trigger a Jenkins job externally using Python? Provide a short code example.**

15. **Explain how you would use Jenkins to trigger a build in response to a certain event, such as an external system sending a POST request to Jenkins.**

---

## ✅ Part 6: Practical Challenge

16. **Create a Jenkins pipeline that:**
   - Uses a Docker image to run the build.
   - Installs necessary dependencies (e.g., using `pip` for Python projects).
   - Runs unit tests.
   - If tests pass, pushes the Docker image to a Docker registry.
   - Uses parameters passed from an external source to customize the build process.
