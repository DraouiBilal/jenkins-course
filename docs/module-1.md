# 🧱 Module 1: What is Jenkins?

## 🎯 Objective
Understand what Jenkins is, its core purpose, and why it’s relevant for modern software and data workflows.

## 🚀 What is Jenkins?

**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server used to **automate** parts of the **software development lifecycle**—especially building, testing, and deploying code.

> Think of Jenkins as your **automation butler**. When code changes, Jenkins steps in and performs predefined tasks—no human interaction needed.

---

## 🛠️ What Can Jenkins Do?

- Build and compile code  
- Run unit/integration tests  
- Package applications (e.g., create Docker images)  
- Deploy to staging or production environments  
- Send notifications via Slack, email, etc.  
- Trigger data processing pipelines or API tests

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

Imagine working in a data team where:
- Someone pushes an update to a data ingestion script.
- Jenkins detects the change.
- It checks that the script passes linting and tests.
- If everything looks good, it deploys the script to run on Airflow or uploads it to a data lake.

All of that happens **automatically**, thanks to Jenkins.

## 💡 Why Jenkins Stands Out

- **Extensible:** Thousands of plugins  
- **Language-Agnostic:** Works with Python, Java, Node.js, etc.  
- **Cross-Platform:** Linux, macOS, Windows support  
- **Scalable:** Single server → distributed agents → cloud-native setups
