# 🧩 Module 2: Why Jenkins? Why CI/CD?

## 🎯 Objective
Understand the problems Jenkins solves and why CI/CD is essential in modern development and data workflows.

---

## ❌ Life Before Jenkins (The Problem)

- Manual build and deployment steps  
- Developers pushing untested code to production  
- Difficult to reproduce bugs: "It works on my machine!"  
- Long delays between writing code and seeing it in action  
- Error-prone and inconsistent release processes  

---

## ✅ Enter Jenkins + CI/CD

### 🔄 CI: Continuous Integration

> Every time someone pushes code, the system automatically:
- Fetches the latest code
- Builds the application
- Runs tests (unit/integration/linting)
- Alerts the team if something breaks

CI ensures:
- Code is always in a **working** state
- Bugs are caught **early**
- Teams integrate often and safely

---

### 🚀 CD: Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment

- **Continuous Delivery:** Code changes are automatically tested and made ready for **manual** deployment.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Code is automatically tested and **deployed** to production without human intervention.

CI/CD = Automating the **build → test → deploy** pipeline

---

## 🧠 Analogy

Imagine a **data engineering workflow** like:
- You update a DBT model or Airflow DAG.
- Jenkins notices the change.
- It tests your SQL or Python scripts.
- If tests pass, it pushes them to staging or deploys to production.

Without you clicking a thing.

## ⚡ Benefits of CI/CD

- Faster release cycles  
- Higher code quality  
- Less manual work = fewer mistakes  
- Consistent, reproducible builds  
- Quick feedback for developers  
- Confidence in deploying often  

---

## 🧪 CI/CD in Data Engineering

Even if you're not building web apps, CI/CD still helps:
- Test data pipelines before deployment  
- Validate schema or data contracts  
- Deploy infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, dbt, etc.)  
- Run automated quality checks on datasets
